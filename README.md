# cardioid-times-table

this project was inspired by [Mathologer]

and shows a [cardioid] times table 

to get other shapes change the values in the `js/index.js` file 

especially the `times` value (it's a float) but you can also try changing the `total_points`

```js
const total_points = 200;
const times = 2;
```
